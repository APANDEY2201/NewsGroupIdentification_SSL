### NewsGroupIdentification_SSL

The main objective is detection (i.e. classification) of the respective categories of the data set using semi supervised learning (SSL). 
 
 The data is passed through a preprocessing pipeline, which is essentially the first
step for building the model.

Some of the preprocessing steps are:
- [x]  Tokenization
- [x]  Lower casing
- [x]  Stop word removal
- [x]  Stemming or Lemmatization

Future work involves application of:
- [ ] Bag of words
- [ ] Word Embedding - word2vec
- [ ] LDA based topic model
- [ ] TF-IDF
